I graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in July 2023 and obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic Information Engineering (Computer Engineering stream) with First Class Honours. Meanwhile, I was awarded the Dean's List for three consecutive years.

Starting from September 2024, I begin my journey at the University of Waterloo as a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
