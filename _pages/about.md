I am an MEng ECE student at the University of Waterloo (UWaterloo). Currently, I am working with [Joseph Chen](https://uwaterloo.ca/distributed-algorithms-systems-lab/profiles/chien-chih-joseph-chen) from the Distributed Algorithms and Systems Lab at UWaterloo on LLMs-based agent modeling and simulation. Previously, I graduated from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in July 2023 and obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic Information Engineering (Computer Engineering stream). After that, I worked as a research assistant with [Dr. Yatong Han](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=qO7xbbgAAAAJ) on embodied agent systems at Future Network of Intelligence Institute, CUHK-SZ.
