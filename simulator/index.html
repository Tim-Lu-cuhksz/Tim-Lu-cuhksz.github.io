  <h1>Leaderboard Simulation via LLM Agents</h1>
  <p>To access the simulation website, please contact <a href= "mailto:d72@uwaterloo.ca">d72@uwaterloo.ca</a> beforehand to set up the server (for now the website is deployed locally only).</p>
  
  <p> Click <a href="https://urgently-neat-bass.ngrok-free.app">link</a> to access the simulator once the server is set up. </p>

  <h2> Settings </h2>
  <p>We use gpt-4o-mini to simulate different roles including CTO, CFO, and COO. <br> <br> We set the number of rounds to 6 where different roles take turns to express their opinions.
    Note that the interface displays the responses only when the backend finishes all 6 rounds. 
  </p>

  <h2> An Example </h2>
  <p>Here is an example of the interface. You could type the message in the chatbox and wait a bit for the backend to generate the responses.</p>
